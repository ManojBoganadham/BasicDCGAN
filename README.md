# BasicDCGAN
 A basic DCGAN project using fashion mnist dataset
 
This is a DCGAN model with a CNN architecture consisting of only few layers of convolutions.
The famous fashionMNIST dataset has been used to train the model.<br> Generative Adversarial 
Networks or GANs are a generative modeling approach using Deep Learning to train the model in a 
clever manner to generate data by using the sub-model approach. <br>

Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Networks (DCGANs in short) are the GANs which use the
**Convolution** technique. <br>

These models contain two sub-models. <br>
1. Generator **G** <br>
2. Discriminator **D**<br>
